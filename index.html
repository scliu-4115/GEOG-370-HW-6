<h1>Homework 6 </h1>

<h2>Part 1</h2>
<h3>The map displayed measures the number of doctorate degree holders aged 25 or older per county in Arizona in 2020. The data used was taken from a 2020 table measuring the highest level of education in adults aged 25 or older by county in Arizona.</h3>

<h2>Part 2</h2>
<h3>The ratio that I used for the following three maps was doctorate holders aged 25+ in Arizona divided by the total population aged 25+ in Arizona. I multiplied the ratio by 1000 to get the resulting values over 1. I chose this ratio because I believed that Arizona's 25+ population was the best option to put the number of doctorate holders 25+ by county into proportion. Also, most of the other data options I could have used for the ratio would not have captured the whole sample population, and I did not want to use the total population because it would have included people like children who could not possibly hold a doctorate.</h3>
<h2>Equal Count</h2>
<h3>Equal Count does a good job of distinguishing between counties with low proportions of doctorate holders aged 25+, but counties with the largest proportions end up getting lumped together under one bracket even though the actual proportions may differ considerably.</h3>

<h2>Equal Interval</h2>
<h3>Equal Interval does a good job of distinguishing between counties with high proportions of doctorate holders aged 25+, but counties with the lowest proportions end up getting lumped together under one bracket despite there being a proportionately broad range of numbers covered by that bracket.</h3>

<h2>Fixed Interval</h2>
<h3>Fixed Interval splits the difference between Equal Count and Equal Interval. Counties with higher proportions of doctorate holders aged 25+ are well-distinguished and while the counties with the lowest proportions of doctorate holders aged 25+ tend to get lumped under one bracket, that bracket covers a narrower range of numbers than Equal Interval does.</h3>
